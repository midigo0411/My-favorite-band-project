    <p> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Polycarp</span></p>
    <p class ="article"> Polycarp, aka Fancy Fingers, is perhaps the least popular in the Sauti Sol music 
        group as he doesn't sing. And you know how tricky it is to stand out when you are rarely 
        part of the vocals that fans always look forward to. Nonetheless, the talented guitarist has 
        managed to stay afloat in the band since its inception, thanks to the incredible bond the quartet 
        shares. Otieno was born on November 14, 1987, making him 33 in 2020. Polycarp learnt playing his 
        favourite musical instrument, the guitar at All Saints Cathedral where he was getting free lessons. He is 
        immensely talented in playing the guitar and has produced for several famous artists including
         Suzanna Owiyo and Dela. He appreciates the opportunity of being part of Kenya’s most successful band that 
         has elevated his skills over the years. Is Polycarp Otieno married? The Sauti Sol member is married to Mandy. 
         The ceremony happened in a secret, invite-only wedding at the Fairmont Mt. Kenya Safari Club. Before the 
         elegant wedding, the couple did a colourful traditional wedding in Bujumbura, Burundi.</p>
